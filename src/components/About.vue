    >I was so keen to get making it actually didn't read the bit about "slider" until after I made the home page search layout to be the standard scrolling of search results</p>
    <p>Upon making the sliders I found it tricky to make them mobile responsive and the animated, therefore I have given two slider varieties.</p>
    <span>Things to impress:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Vue-Router - each movie loads its own url using the name and id in the url</li>
      <li>On go back from film details, the film search is cached</li>
      <li>Mobile Responsive - using Bootstrap-vue to speed up the styling</li>
      <li>Load spinners - nice touch</li>
      <li>Type and press enter to see results</li>
      <li>Slider2 is handcoded with no pluggins or frameworks and animated with start, stop buttons</li>
    </ul>
